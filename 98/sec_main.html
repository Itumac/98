To be honest, it's a rare occasion I feel like adding things at all. I have ideas all the time about what to put here but do you know how hard it is to maintain a site? --NOT VERY. Nah, scratch that--  really, I don't have much I want to say. Every year or so I write a <A HREF="fire.html" TARGET="content">poem</A> on a note pad, feeling all inspired... I read it a week later; it sounds <A HREF="blackjack/index.html" TARGET="content">stupid</A> and I end up writing over it with bills or something. That's that. Plus, I'm the only one who visits this site anyway. I put up the Q&A thing on <A HREF="vivarium/index.html"TARGET="newsite">The Vivarium</A> and nobody  has asked me a damn thing. You have to know how to spell Camuti to find the site and my <A HREF="cousin/index.html" TARGET="newsite">family</A> already thinks  I'm wierd so why should I bother? Perhaps one day I will contribute to this planet in some more meaningful way.  But I'm not the one turning the crank on the meat-grinder. If my part of the "cosmic chuck round" goes through and becomes hamburger,  fine. Until then, here's the frozen steak. <P> -TC</FONT></TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER></BODY></HTML>

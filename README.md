Tim Camuti's (Itumac) personal page
I'm a <b>digital designer</b> with over 25 years of experience.
- Digital is my medium.
- My design discipline is <b>user experience</b> in the true sense.
- I employ many sub-disciplines to create experiences.
-   IA, User interface, interaction, product design... and so on.

Over the years, my given title has evolved: 
(these dates are spitballed, I'm  not a UX historian, yet.)
- 2024 – ????, I'd be labeled a "Product designer"
- 2010 – 2022 I'd be labeled a "UX designer"
- 2000 – 2010 I'd be labeled a "UI/UX designer"
- <2000 - "Web Designer" or even, "Graphics Designer"  <-- with an "S"
- 
Knowing how to code UI and front-end goes in and out of fashion with the role.
My repos here in no way represent distinctive or important work I've done. A quick peek at them will confirm the veracity of that statement.

Thanks for reading my snarky comments written here on January 11, 2024, after taking an hour to break back into my account and back up my current website [camuti.com](https://www.camuti.com/)
